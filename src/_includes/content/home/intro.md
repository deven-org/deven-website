**Hello** there! Engineering can be a lot of fun, right?
We know it's not always a walk in the
<span aria-hidden="true">🌳</span>&#8205;Park&#8205;<span aria-hidden="true">🌲</span>
though.
Sometimes you may
<span aria-hidden="true">🏃🏾</span>&#8205;run&#8205;<span aria-hidden="true">🏃🏼</span>
into obstacles because of missing or complicated processes.

That's where **DEVEN**, short for <em>Dev</em>elopment <em>En</em>ablement,
comes in:
An **open-source** project that’s designed to make your work life smoother and
your projects healthier.
