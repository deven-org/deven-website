## What is it?

We have all worked on projects where documentation was either missing or was more confusing than helpful. The team lost all their trust in the docs and didn't update them anymore. And it's totally understandable. They might not have had enough time or experience to create documentation that actually serves its purpose.

However, when it's time to onboard a new team member or explain how the application works, you need proper documentation.

That's why we created our documentation skeleton - it's a simple and easy-to-use tool that provides a structure and examples for adding documentation to your project. Give it a try and make your project more human-friendly!
