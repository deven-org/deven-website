## What is it?

HAMSTER (**H**ierarchical **A**ttribute **M**apping **S**chema for **T**horough **E**ntity **R**ecords) is like a little home for data, where all the information about different things is neatly documented and organized on top of each other.

Imagine each piece of data structure as a tiny food pellet, and HAMSTER is like a storage system that keeps them in a neat and organized manner. This makes sure that all the information is comprehensive and accurate.

So, in a way, HAMSTER helps to keep data well-structured and documented. It might not involve running on a wheel or munching on seeds, but it's essential for people who want to manage their information effectively!
