## What is it?

Have you ever spent countless hours building a design system for a project, only to have to do it all over again for the next one? We know the feeling.

That's why we've put our heads together to create B01LER - a user-friendly, token-based design system boilerplate that helps your team easily create cohesive and consistent designs across all platforms and products. B01LER streamlines the design process and saves time by providing pre-built design components, best practices, and a flexible architecture that can be customized to meet your brand's unique needs.

On top of that, it makes collaboration between engineering and design teams much easier and clearer. With B01LER, your teams can work smarter and create better products in less time.
