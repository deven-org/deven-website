## ‚ú® Happy 3-2-1 treats day!‚ú®
Good day everyone,

It is time for another round of our newsletter.

This week is [Internaut Day](https://home.cern/news/news/computing/internaut-day-and-world-wide-web). The 23.08.1991 is generally seen as the day the World Wide Web went public.

Nobody could forsee the impact this will have on the whole world.
For most people a life without the open web would be drastically different.

That is why this edition of the newsletter will focus on open standards and software in the public domain.

As usual I prepared 3 things for learners, 2 things for doers, and 1 question for thinkers all about the topic open source and open standards. No matter if you are a learner, a doer, a thinker, two or all of them, we hope you‚Äôll find something to enjoy.


## 3 things for learners

## 1 question for thinkers

<br />

Thank you for reading!

If you have any resources you think your colleagues should know about, please let me know, so it can be added to a future newsletter.<br />

P.S.: This time there is no CodePen coding challenge. Instead we want to challenge you to contribute to a open source software of your choice.

If you do not know where to start you can follow the second link under the [2 things for doers](#2-things-for-doers).

Any kind of contribution that improves a project is a good and worthwhile time investment. This does not need to be a code change, it can also include documentation updates, fixing typos and others.

Happy contributing üßë‚ÄçüöÄ
