## ✨ Happy 3-2-1 treats day!✨
Good day everyone,

It is time for another round of our newsletter.

Did you know that this week 41 years ago, on the 26.06.1983, [the first successful test of DNS happened](https://www.wired.com/2011/06/0623dns-domain-name-system-tested/)?

The Domain Name System played a major role in the commercialization of the internet by giving the possibility to navigate the web over names.

As developers we know one thing for sure though, [naming things is hard](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html).


This time I prepared 3 things for learners, 2 things for doers, and 1 question for thinkers all about the topic of DNS and naming things. No matter if you are a learner, a doer, a thinker, two or all of them, we hope you’ll find something to enjoy.

Thank you for reading!

If you have any resources you think your colleagues should know about, please let me know, so it can be added to a future newsletter.<br />

P.S.: This time there is no CodePen coding challenge. Instead we want to challenge you to have a look at the code of your current project. Is the naming of variables, functions and files consistent?

If that is not the case (pun intended) start a conversation with your fellow developers to align an a standard for your project. It is possible to follow different conventions for different use cases, e.g. camelCase for variables and snake_case for file name.
