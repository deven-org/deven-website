## ‚ú® Happy 3-2-1 treats day!‚ú®
Good day everyone,

It is time for another round of our newsletter.

Do you know that the patent for the barcode was granted 72 years ago on the 07.10.1952. Bernard Silver overheard a conversation where a president of a grocery store chain asked a dean for help automating the checkout process. He told his friend Joe Woodland about it and together they invented the bar code which was the base of the QR code.

For a brief history on bar codes and the evolution to QR codes I can recommend a recent [video from Veritasium](https://youtu.be/w5ebcowAJD8?si=fw3Y0t_eWHx0Lfv5).

Please enjoy the 3 things for learners, 2 things for doers, and 1 question for thinkers all about the topic of innovation, like the bar code innovated the way machines could read visualized data. No matter if you are a learner, a doer, a thinker, two or all of them, I hope you‚Äôll find something to enjoy.
