## ‚ú® Happy 3-2-1 treats day!‚ú®
Good day everyone,

Welcome to the Easter themed newsletter üê∞

You might be familiar with the [egg hunt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_hunt) tradition at Easter, this newsletter is all about hunting the developers favorite egg; the bug.

As custom I prepared 3 things for learners, 2 things for doers, and 1 question for thinkers to sprinkle some glitter on your day. No matter if you are a learner, a doer, a thinker, two or all of them, we hope you‚Äôll find something to enjoy.

## 1 question for thinkers
What is your favorite bug you have ever encountered?
Mine was a [Heisenbug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisenbug) which took me days to fully track down.
Share your answer with your colleagues and let them know how the bug was solved eventually.

<br />

Thank you for reading!

If you have any resources you think your colleagues should know about, please let me know, so it can be added to a future newsletter.<br />
