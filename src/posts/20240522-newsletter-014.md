## ‚ú® Happy 3-2-1 treats day!‚ú®
Good day everyone,

It is time for another round of our newsletter.

Did you know that this week 180 years ago, on the 24.05.1884, [the first ever standardized "network" message was send](https://www.loc.gov/item/mmorse000107)?

Samuel Morse send the first message using his morse code via telegraph over a distance of over 60km.

Since then networks have changed drastically and for us as web developers it is important to understand the basics to create the best solutions possible.


This time I prepared 3 things for learners, 2 things for doers, and 1 question for thinkers all about the topic of networks. No matter if you are a learner, a doer, a thinker, two or all of them, we hope you‚Äôll find something to enjoy.
