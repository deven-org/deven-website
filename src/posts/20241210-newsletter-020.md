## âœ¨ Happy 3-2-1 treats day!âœ¨
Good day everyone,

the year comes to an end. For many, it is a time to reflect and envision what comes next. This time of the year invites us to reflect not only on our achievements but also on the contributions of those whose vision has shaped our world. One such visionary is [Ada Lovelace](https://findingada.com/about/who-was-ada/).

Ada wrote a computer algorithm before the invention of the computer or programming languages. Based on a theoretical concept by [Charles Babbage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage) -[the difference engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_engine)- she created an [algorithm to calculate the Bernoulli numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note_G).

Even more fascinating to me is her vision about the possibility that more than numbers (in the mathematical sense) can be processed. She saw the potential to process and create music, graphics and language.

Please enjoy the 3 things for learners, 2 things for doers, and 1 question for thinkers all inspired by Ada Lovelace, her creativity, vision and contribution to computer science. No matter if you are a learner, a doer, a thinker, two or all of them, I hope youâ€™ll find something to enjoy.

Thank you for reading!

If you have any resources you think other people should know about, please [let me know](https://forms.gle/d2jHNTzdZsQxRrhw5), so it can be added to a future newsletter.<br />
See you all next year! ðŸŽ‡<br />

P.S.: There is no coding challenge in this edition. Lets take a step back from coding and algorithms at the end of the year to focus on something else - reflection.
Take some time to pause, think and reset. Reflect on what you are grateful for, celebrate positive experiences and set your intentions for the new year.
