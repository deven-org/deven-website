## ‚ú® Another round of 3-2-1 treats.‚ú®

Every few weeks, you will get 3 things for learners, 2 things for doers, and 1 question for thinkers to sprinkle some glitter on your day. No matter if you are a learner, a doer, a thinker, two or all of them‚Ä¶ I hope you‚Äôll find something to enjoy.


## 3 things for learners

<br /> 

Thank you for reading!

This is the last newsletter for this year, but no worries it will continue next year with even more  things to learn, do and think about. üéâ

If you have any resources you think your colleagues should know about, please hit reply and let us know, so we can add it to a future newsletter.

We wish you all happy holidays, take a break and enjoy the quiet time at the end of the year. ‚ô•Ô∏è<br />
Ola & Julian from DEVEN

<br />

P.S.: We‚Äôll skip the coding challenge this time as we want you to take a break. We will continue them with the next newsletter, promised.

But we do have an ask‚Ä¶ if you are up to it: show appreciation to your colleagues for what they did this year, spread some love üíå
