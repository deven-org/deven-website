## âœ¨ Happy 3-2-1 treats day!âœ¨
Good day everyone,

It is time for another round of our newsletter.

One of the most iconic cyber movies in history, at least in my humble opinion, celebrated recently its 29th anniversary. On the 15.09.1995 the magnificent movie [Hackers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers_(film)) was released.

The movie is still celebrated by many tech folks, especially in the [security sector](https://www.vice.com/en/article/real-hackers-tell-us-why-they-love-the-movie-hackers/) and that for a good reason if you ask me.

If you never saw the movie, plan it for your next movie night, it is highly recommended.

Please enjoy the 3 things for learners, 2 things for doers, and 1 question for thinkers all about the topic security and hacking, as a tribute to the movie. No matter if you are a learner, a doer, a thinker, two or all of them, we hope youâ€™ll find something to enjoy.

P.S.: This time there is no CodePen coding challenge. Instead we want to share a playground where you can do multiple challenges regarding web security.

Go to the interactive cyber security platform and try out a few sessions:<br>

If you are stuck at any level feel free to share it with your peers and try to find a solution together.
