## ‚ú® Happy 3-2-1 treats day!‚ú®
Good day everyone,

It is time for another round of our newsletter.

Did you know that on the 23.04.2005 (19 years ago) the first ever YouTube video was uploaded?
It is called [me at the zoo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Me_at_the_zoo) and features YouTubes co-founder Jawed Karim.

This time I prepared 3 things for learners, 2 things for doers, and 1 question for thinkers all about the topic of videos and animations. No matter if you are a learner, a doer, a thinker, two or all of them, we hope you‚Äôll find something to enjoy.
